WooCommerce Move Category Description down in the page.

== Description ==

WooCommerce Move Category Description down in the page.

== Installation ==

* Use WordPress’ builtin plugin installation system located in your WordPress admin panel, labeled as the "Add New" options in the "Plugins" menu to upload the zip file you downloaded
* Extract the zip file and upload the resulting "ink" folder on your server under `wp-content/plugins/`.

All you need to do after that is navigate to your blog’s administration panel, go in the plugins section and enable WooCommerce Category Description Down.
